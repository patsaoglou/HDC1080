# HDC1080
In this repository, i share a STM32 Firmware driver for the TI HDC1080 Temperature and Humidity IC. I also supply the datasheet document provided by the manufacturer with notes i did that were important for the initialization of the IC. You are also going to find comments about what the code on each function does.
